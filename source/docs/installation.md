- [All Omnitrace Releases](https://github.com/ROCm/omnitrace/releases)

## Quick Start (Latest Release, Binary Installer)

Download the [omnitrace-install.py](https://github.com/ROCm/omnitrace/releases/latest/download/omnitrace-install.py)
and specify `--prefix <install-directory>`. This script will attempt to auto-detect the appropriate OS
distribution and OS version. If ROCm support is desired, specify `--rocm X.Y` where `X` is the ROCm major
version and `Y` is the ROCm minor version, e.g. `--rocm 6.0`.

```shell
wget https://github.com/ROCm/omnitrace/releases/latest/download/omnitrace-install.py
python3 ./omnitrace-install.py --prefix /opt/omnitrace --rocm 6.0
```

This script supports installation on Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, RedHat, Debian, CentOS, and Fedora.
If the target OS is compatible with one of the [operating system versions](#operating-system-support) below,
specify `-d <DISTRO> -v <VERSION>`, e.g. if the OS is compatible with Ubuntu 18.04, pass
`-d ubuntu -v 18.04` to the script.

## Operating System Support

OmniTrace is only supported on Linux. The following distributions are tested:

- Ubuntu 18.04
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ubuntu 22.04
- OpenSUSE 15.2
- OpenSUSE 15.3
- OpenSUSE 15.4
- RedHat 8.7
- RedHat 9.0
- RedHat 9.1

Other OS distributions may be supported but are not tested.

### Identifying the Operating System

If you are unsure of the operating system and version, the `/etc/os-release` and `/usr/lib/os-release` files contain operating system identification data for Linux systems.

```shell
$ cat /etc/os-release
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
ID=ubuntu
...
VERSION_ID="20.04"
...
```

The relevent fields are `ID` and the `VERSION_ID`.

## Architecture

With regards to instrumentation, at present only amd64 (x86_64) architectures are tested; however,
Dyninst supports several more architectures and thus, omnitrace instrumentation may support other
CPU architectures such as aarch64, ppc64, etc.
Other modes of use, such as sampling and causal profiling, are not dependent on Dyninst and therefore
may be more portable.

## Installing omnitrace from binary distributions

Every omnitrace release provides binary installer scripts of the form:

```shell
omnitrace-{VERSION}-{OS_DISTRIB}-{OS_VERSION}[-ROCm-{ROCM_VERSION}[-{EXTRA}]].sh
```

E.g.:

```shell
omnitrace-1.0.0-ubuntu-18.04-OMPT-PAPI-Python3.sh
omnitrace-1.0.0-ubuntu-18.04-ROCm-405000-OMPT-PAPI-Python3.sh
...
omnitrace-1.0.0-ubuntu-20.04-ROCm-50000-OMPT-PAPI-Python3.sh
```

Any of the EXTRA fields with a cmake build option (e.g. PAPI, see below) or no link requirements (e.g. OMPT) have
self-contained support for these packages.

### Download the appropriate binary distribution

```shell
wget https://github.com/ROCm/omnitrace/releases/download/v<VERSION>/<SCRIPT>
```

### Create the target installation directory

```shell
mkdir /opt/omnitrace
```

### Run the installer script

```shell
./omnitrace-1.0.0-ubuntu-18.04-ROCm-405000-OMPT-PAPI.sh --prefix=/opt/omnitrace --exclude-subdir
```

## Installing OmniTrace from source

### Build Requirements

OmniTrace needs a GCC compiler with full support for C++17 and CMake v3.16 or higher.
The Clang compiler may be used in lieu of the GCC compiler if Dyninst is already installed.

- GCC compiler v7+
  - Older GCC compilers may be supported but are not tested
  - Clang compilers are generally supported for [OmniTrace](https://github.com/ROCm/omnitrace) but not Dyninst
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) v3.16+

> ***If the system installed cmake is too old, installing a new version of cmake can be done through several methods.***
> ***One of the easiest options is to use PyPi (i.e. python's pip):***
>
> ```shell
> pip install --user 'cmake==3.18.4'
> export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}
> ```

### Required Third-Party Packages

- [DynInst](https://github.com/dyninst/dyninst) for dynamic or static instrumentation
  - [TBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB) required by Dyninst
  - [ElfUtils](https://sourceware.org/elfutils/) required by Dyninst
  - [LibIberty](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/tree/master/libiberty) required by Dyninst

### Installing DynInst

#### Building Dyninst alongside OmniTrace

The easiest way to install Dyninst is to configure omnitrace with `OMNITRACE_BUILD_DYNINST=ON`. Depending on the version of Ubuntu, the apt package manager may have current enough
versions of Dyninst's Boost, TBB, and LibIberty dependencies (i.e. `apt-get install libtbb-dev libiberty-dev libboost-dev`); however, it is possible to request Dyninst to install
it's dependencies via `DYNINST_BUILD_<DEP>=ON`, e.g.:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/omnitrace.git omnitrace-source
cmake -B omnitrace-build -DOMNITRACE_BUILD_DYNINST=ON -DDYNINST_BUILD_{TBB,ELFUTILS,BOOST,LIBIBERTY}=ON omnitrace-source
```

where `-DDYNINST_BUILD_{TBB,BOOST,ELFUTILS,LIBIBERTY}=ON` is expanded by the shell to `-DDYNINST_BUILD_TBB=ON -DDYNINST_BUILD_BOOST=ON ...`

#### Installing Dyninst via Spack

[Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) is another option to install Dyninst and it's dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
source ./spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack compiler find
spack external find --all --not-buildable
spack spec -I --reuse dyninst
spack install --reuse dyninst
spack load -r dyninst
```

### Installing omnitrace

OmniTrace has cmake configuration options for supporting MPI (`OMNITRACE_USE_MPI` or `OMNITRACE_USE_MPI_HEADERS`), HIP kernel tracing (`OMNITRACE_USE_ROCTRACER`),
sampling ROCm devices (`OMNITRACE_USE_ROCM_SMI`), OpenMP-Tools (`OMNITRACE_USE_OMPT`), hardware counters via PAPI (`OMNITRACE_USE_PAPI`), among others.
Various additional features can be enabled via the [`TIMEMORY_USE_*` CMake options](https://timemory.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installation.html#cmake-options).
Any `OMNITRACE_USE_<VAL>` option which has a corresponding `TIMEMORY_USE_<VAL>` option means that the support within timemory for this feature has been integrated
into omnitrace's perfetto support, e.g. `OMNITRACE_USE_PAPI=<VAL>` forces `TIMEMORY_USE_PAPI=<VAL>` and the data that timemory is able to collect via this package
is passed along to perfetto and will be displayed when the `.proto` file is visualized in [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/omnitrace.git omnitrace-source
cmake                                       \
    -B omnitrace-build                      \
    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/omnitrace  \
    -D OMNITRACE_USE_HIP=ON                 \
    -D OMNITRACE_USE_ROCM_SMI=ON            \
    -D OMNITRACE_USE_ROCTRACER=ON           \
    -D OMNITRACE_USE_PYTHON=ON              \
    -D OMNITRACE_USE_OMPT=ON                \
    -D OMNITRACE_USE_MPI_HEADERS=ON         \
    -D OMNITRACE_BUILD_PAPI=ON              \
    -D OMNITRACE_BUILD_LIBUNWIND=ON         \
    -D OMNITRACE_BUILD_DYNINST=ON           \
    -D DYNINST_BUILD_TBB=ON                 \
    -D DYNINST_BUILD_BOOST=ON               \
    -D DYNINST_BUILD_ELFUTILS=ON            \
    -D DYNINST_BUILD_LIBIBERTY=ON           \
    omnitrace-source
cmake --build omnitrace-build --target all --parallel 8
cmake --build omnitrace-build --target install
source /opt/omnitrace/share/omnitrace/setup-env.sh
```

#### MPI Support within OmniTrace

[OmniTrace](https://github.com/ROCm/omnitrace) can have full (`OMNITRACE_USE_MPI=ON`) or partial (`OMNITRACE_USE_MPI_HEADERS=ON`) MPI support.
The only difference between these two modes is whether or not the results collected via timemory and/or perfetto can be aggregated into a single
output file during finalization. When full MPI support is enabled, combining the timemory results always occurs whereas combining the perfetto
results is configurable via the `OMNITRACE_PERFETTO_COMBINE_TRACES` setting.

The primary benefits of partial or full MPI support are the automatic wrapping of MPI functions and the ability
to label output with suffixes which correspond to the `MPI_COMM_WORLD` rank ID instead of using the system process identifier (i.e. PID).
In general, it is recommended to use partial MPI support with the OpenMPI headers as this is the most portable configuration.
If full MPI support is selected, make sure your target application is built against the same MPI distribution as omnitrace,
i.e. do not build omnitrace with MPICH and use it on a target application built against OpenMPI.
If partial support is selected, the reason the OpenMPI headers are recommended instead of the MPICH headers is
because the `MPI_COMM_WORLD` in OpenMPI is a pointer to `ompi_communicator_t` (8 bytes), whereas `MPI_COMM_WORLD` in MPICH,
it is an `int` (4 bytes). Building omnitrace with partial MPI support and the MPICH headers and then using
omnitrace on an application built against OpenMPI will cause a segmentation fault due to the value of the `MPI_COMM_WORLD` being narrowed
during the function wrapping before being passed along to the underlying MPI function.

## Post-Installation Steps

### Configure the environment

If environment modules are available and preferred:

```shell
module use /opt/omnitrace/share/modulefiles
module load omnitrace/1.0.0
```

Alternatively, once can directly source the `setup-env.sh` script:

```shell
source /opt/omnitrace/share/omnitrace/setup-env.sh
```

### Test the executables

Successful execution of these commands indicates that the installation does not have any issues locating the installed libraries:

```shell
omnitrace-instrument --help
omnitrace-avail --help
```

> ***NOTE: If ROCm support was enabled, you may have to add the path to the ROCm libraries to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, e.g. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rocm/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}`***
