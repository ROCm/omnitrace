****************************************************
Performing causal profiling
****************************************************

The process of causal profiling can be summarized as:

*If you speed up a given block of code by X%, the application will execute Y% faster*.

Causal profiling directs parallel application developers to where they should focus their optimization
efforts by quantifying the potential impact of optimizations. Causal profiling is rooted in the concept
that *software execution speed is relative*: speeding up a block of code by X% is mathematically equivalent
to that block of code running at its current speed if all the other code running slower by X%.
Thus, causal profiling works by performing experiments on blocks of code during program execution which
insert pauses to slow down all other concurrently running code. During post-processing, these experiments
are translated into calculations for the potential impact of speeding up this block of code.

.. note::

   Causal profiling supersedes the original critical trace feature, which was removed in Omnitrace v1.11.0.

Consider the following C++ code executing ``foo`` and ``bar`` concurrently in two different threads
where ``foo`` is 30% faster than ```bar``` (ideally):

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <cstddef>
   #include <thread>
   constexpr size_t FOO_N =  7 * 1000000000UL;
   constexpr size_t BAR_N = 10 * 1000000000UL;

   void foo()
   {
      for(volatile size_t i = 0; i < FOO_N; ++i) {}
   }

   void bar()
   {
      for(volatile size_t i = 0; i < BAR_N; ++i) {}
   }

   int main()
   {
      std::thread _threads[] = { std::thread{ foo },
                        std::thread{ bar } };

      for(auto& itr : _threads)
         itr.join();
   }

No matter how many optimizations are applied to ``foo``, the application will always 
require the same amount of time
because the end-to-end performance is limited by ``bar``. However, a 5% speed-up 
in ``bar`` will result in the
end-to-end performance improving by 5% and this trend will continue linearly (10% speed-up 
in ``bar`` yields 10% speed-up in
end-to-end performance, and so on) up to 30% speed-up, at which point, ``bar`` executes as fast as ``foo``;
any speed-up to ``bar`` beyond 30% will still only yield an end-to-end performance 
speed-up of 30% since the application
will be limited by performance of ``foo``, as demonstrated below in the causal 
profiling visualization:

The full details of the causal profiling methodology can be found in the paper 
`Coz: Finding Code that Counts with Causal Profiling <http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03676v1.pdf>`_.
The author's implementation is publicly available on `GitHub <https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz>`_.

Getting started
========================================

To effectively use causal profiling, it is important to understand a few key 
concepts, such as progress points.

Progress points
-----------------------------------

Causal profiling requires "progress points" to track progress through the code 
in between samples. Progress points must be triggered in a deterministic manner via instrumentation.
This can happen in three different ways:

* `Omnitrace <https://github.com/ROCm/omnitrace>`_ can leverage the callbacks from 
  Kokkos-Tools, OpenMP-Tools, roctracer, etc. and the wrappers around functions for 
  MPI, NUMA, RCCL, etc. to act as progress points
* Users can leverage the :doc:`runtime instrumentation capabilities <./instrumenting-rewriting-binary-application>` 
  to insert progress points
* Users can leverage the :doc:`User API <../how-to/using-omnitrace-api>`, 
  for example ``OMNITRACE_CAUSAL_PROGRESS``

.. note::

   Binary rewrite to insert progress points is not supported. When a rewritten binary 
   is executed, Dyninst translates the instruction pointer address in order to execute 
   the instrumentation. As a result, call-stack samples never return instruction 
   pointer addresses in the ranges defined as valid by Omnitrace.

+------------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

.. note::

   * Binary scope defaults to ``%MAIN%`` (executable), but the scope can be expanded to include linked libraries.
   * ``<file>`` and ``<file>:<line>`` support requires debug info (i.e. code was compiled with ``-g`` or, preferably, ``-g3``)
   * Function mode does not require debug info but does not support stripped binaries

Backends
-----------------------------------

Both causal profiling backends interrupt each thread 1000x per second of CPU-time to apply virtual speed-ups.
The difference between the backends is how the samples which are responsible calculating 
the virtual speed-up are recorded.
There are 3 key differences between the two backends:

* ``perf`` backend requires Linux Perf and elevated security priviledges
* ``perf`` backend interrupts the application less frequently whereas the ``timer`` backend 
  will interrupt the application 1000x per second of realtime
* ``timer`` backend has less accurate call-stacks due to instruction pointer skid

In general, the ``perf`` is preferred over the ``timer`` backend when sufficient 
security priviledges permit its usage.
If ``OMNITRACE_CAUSAL_BACKEND`` is set to ``auto``, Omnitrace will fallback 
to using the ``timer`` backend only if
using the ``perf`` backend fails; if ``OMNITRACE_CAUSAL_BACKEND`` is 
set to ``perf`` and using this backend fails, Omnitrace
will abort.

Instruction pointer skid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instruction pointer (IP) skid is how many instructions execute between an event of interest
happening and where the IP is when the kernel is able to stop the application.
For the ``timer`` backend, this translates to the
difference between when the IP when the timer generated a signal and the IP when the
signal was actually generated. Although IP skid does still occur with the ``perf`` backend,
the overhead of pausing the entire thread with the ``timer`` backend makes this much more pronounced
and, as such, the ``timer`` backend tends to have a lower resolution than the ``perf`` backend,
especially in ``line`` mode.

Installing Linux Perf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Linux Perf is built into the kernel and may already be installed 
(e.g., included in the default kernel for OpenSUSE).
The official method of checking whether Linux Perf is installed is 
checking for the existence of the file
``/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid`` -- if the file exists, the kernel has Perf installed.

If this file does not exist, on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, install (as superuser):

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic linux-tools-$(uname -r)

and reboot your computer. In order to use the ``perf`` backend, the value 
of ``/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid``
should be <= 2. If the value in this file is greater than 2, you will likely be 
unable to use the perf backend.

To update the paranoid level temporarily (until the system is rebooted), run 
one of the following methods
as a superuser (where ``PARANOID_LEVEL=<N>`` with ``<N>`` in the range ``[-1, 2]``):

.. code-block:: shell

   echo ${PARANOID_LEVEL} | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
   sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=${PARANOID_LEVEL}

To make the paranoid level persistent after a reboot, add ``kernel.perf_event_paranoid=<N>``
(where ``<N>`` is the desired paranoid level) to the ``/etc/sysctl.conf`` file.

Speed-up prediction variability and the ``omnitrace-causal`` executable
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Causal profiling typically require executing the application several times in 
order to adequately sample all the domains of executing code, experiment 
speed-ups, etc. and resolve statistical fluctuations.
The ``omnitrace-causal`` executable is designed to simplify running this procedure:

.. code-block:: shell

                                                   ]

      Causal profiling usually requires multiple runs to reliably resolve the speedup estimates.
      This executable is designed to streamline that process.
      For example (assume all commands end with \'-- <exe> <args>\'):

         omnitrace-causal -n 5 -- <exe>                  # runs <exe> 5x with causal profiling enabled

         omnitrace-causal -s 0 5,10,15,20                # runs <exe> 2x with virtual speedups:
                                                         #   - 0
                                                         #   - randomly selected from 5, 10, 15, and 20

         omnitrace-causal -F func_A func_B func_(A|B)    # runs <exe> 3x with the function scope limited to:
                                                         #   1. func_A
                                                         #   2. func_B
                                                         #   3. func_A or func_B
      General tips:
      - Insert progress points at hotspots in your code or use omnitrace\'s runtime instrumentation
         - Note: binary rewrite will produce a incompatible new binary
      - Run omnitrace-causal in "function" mode first (does not require debug info)
      - Run omnitrace-causal in "line" mode when you are targeting one function (requires debug info)
         - Preferably, use predictions from the "function" mode to determine which function to target
      - Limit the virtual speedups to a smaller pool, e.g., 0,5,10,25,50, to get reliable predictions quicker
      - Make use of the binary, source, and function scope to limit the functions/lines selected for experiments
         - Note: source scope requires debug info

      --version                      Prints the version and exit

      [DEBUG OPTIONS]

      --monochrome                   Disable colorized output
      --debug                        Debug output

      [GENERAL OPTIONS]

      -c, --config                   Base configuration file
      -l, --launcher                 When running MPI jobs, omnitrace-causal needs to be *before* the executable which launches the MPI processes (i.e.
                                    before `mpirun`, `srun`, etc.). Pass the name of the target executable (or a regex for matching to the name of the
                                    target) for causal profiling, e.g., `omnitrace-causal -l foo -- mpirun -n 4 foo`. This ensures that the omnitrace
                                    library is LD_PRELOADed on the proper target
      -g, --generate-configs         Generate config files instead of passing environment variables directly. If no arguments are provided, the config files
                                    will be placed in ${PWD}/omnitrace-causal-config folder
      --no-defaults                  Do not activate default features which are recommended for causal profiling. For example: PID-tagging of output files
                                    and timestamped subdirectories are disabled by default. Kokkos tools support is added by default
                                    (OMNITRACE_USE_KOKKOSP=ON) because, for Kokkos applications, the Kokkos-Tools callbacks are used for progress points.
                                    Activation of OpenMP tools support is similar

      [CAUSAL PROFILING OPTIONS (General)]
                                    (These settings will be applied to all causal profiling runs)

      -m, --mode [ function (func) | line ]
                                    Causal profiling mode
      -o, --output-name              Output filename of causal profiling data w/o extension
      -r, --reset                    Overwrite any existing experiment results during the first run
      -e, --end-to-end               Single causal experiment for the entire application runtime
      -w, --wait                     Set the wait time (i.e. delay) before starting the first causal experiment (in seconds)
      -d, --duration                 Set the length of time (in seconds) to perform causal experimentationafter the first experiment is started. Once this
                                    amount of time has elapsed, no more causal experiments will be started but any currently running experiment will be
                                    allowed to finish.
      -n, --iterations               Number of times to repeat the combination of run configurations

      [CAUSAL PROFILING OPTIONS (Combinatorial)]
                                    (Each individual argument to these options will multiply the number runs by the number of arguments and the number of
                                    iterations. E.g. -n 2 -B "MAIN" -F "foo" "bar" will produce 4 runs: 2 iterations x 1 binary scope x 2 function scopes
                                    (MAIN+foo, MAIN+bar, MAIN+foo, MAIN+bar))

      -s, --speedups                 Pool of virtual speedups to sample from during experimentation. Each space designates a group and multiple speedups can
                                    be grouped together by commas, e.g. -s 0 0,10,20-50 is two groups: group #1 is \'0\' and group #2 is \'0 10 20 25 30 35 40
                                    45 50\'
      -B, --binary-scope             Restricts causal experiments to the binaries matching the list of regular expressions. Each space designates a group

Using ``omnitrace-causal`` with other launchers like ``mpirun``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``omnitrace-causal`` executable is intended to assist with application replay 
and is designed to always be at the start of the command-line (i.e. the primary process).
``omnitrace-causal`` typically adds a ``LD_PRELOAD`` of the Omnitrace libraries 
into the environment before launching the command in order to inject the functionality
required to start the causal profiling tooling. However, this is problematic 
when the target application for causal profiling requires another command-line
tool in order to run, e.g. ``foo`` is the target application but executing ``foo`` 
requires ``mpirun -n 2 foo``. If one were to simply do ``omnitrace-causal -- mpirun -n 2 foo``,
then the causal profiling would be applied to ``mpirun`` instead of ``foo``. 
``omnitrace-causal`` remedies this by providing a command-line option ``-l` / `--launcher``
to indicate the target application is using a launcher script/executable. The 
argument to the command-line option is the name of (or regex for) the target application
on the command-line. When ``--launcher`` is used, ``omnitrace-causal`` will generate 
all the replay configurations and execute them but delay adding the ``LD_PRELOAD``, instead it
will inject a call to itself into the command-line right before the target 
application. This recursive call to itself will inherit the configuration from
parent ``omnitrace-causal`` executable, insert an ``LD_PRELOAD`` into the environment, 
and then invoke an ``execv`` to replace itself with the new process launched by the target
application.

In other words, the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   omnitrace-causal -l foo -n 3 -- mpirun -n 2 foo`

Effectively results in:

.. code-block:: shell

   mpirun -n 2 omnitrace-causal -- foo
   mpirun -n 2 omnitrace-causal -- foo
   mpirun -n 2 omnitrace-causal -- foo

Visualizing the causal output
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Omnitrace generates a ``causal/experiments.json`` and ``causal/experiments.coz`` in 
``${OMNITRACE_OUTPUT_PATH}/${OMNITRACE_OUTPUT_PREFIX}``. A standalone GUI for viewing the causal profiling
results in under development but until this is available, visit 
`plasma-umass.org/coz <https://plasma-umass.org/coz/>`_ and open the ``*.coz`` file.

Omnitrace versus Coz
=======================================

This comparison is intended for readers who are familiar with the 
`Coz profiler <https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz>`_.
Omnitrace provides several additional features and utilities for causal profiling:

.. csv-table:: 
   :header: "Feature", "Coz", "Omnitrace", "Notes"
   :widths: 20, 60, 60, 30

   "Debug info", "requires debug info in DWARF v3 format (``-gdwarf-3``)", "optional, supports any DWARF format version", "See Note #1 below"
   "Experiment selection", "``<file>:<line>``", "``<function>`` or ``<file>:<line>``", "See Note #2 below"
   "Experiment speed-ups", "Randomly samples b/t 0..100 in increments of 5 or one fixed speed-up", "Supports specifying smaller subset", "See Note #3 below"
   "Scope options", "Supports binary and source scopes", "Supports binary, source, and function scopes", "See Note #4, #5, and #6 below"
   "Scope inclusion", "Uses ``%`` as wildcard for binary and source scopes", "Full regex support for binary, source, and function scopes", ""
   "Scope exclusion", "Not supported", "Supports regexes for excluding binary/source/function", "See Note #7 below"
   "Call-stack sampling", "Linux Perf", "Linux Perf, libunwind", "See Note #8 below"

.. note::

  #. Omnitrace supports a "function" mode which does not require debug info
  #. Omnitrace supports selecting entire range of instruction pointers for a function instead 
     of instruction pointer for one line. In large codes, "function" mode
     can resolve in fewer iterations and once a target function is identified, one can 
     switch to line mode and limit the function scope to the target function
  #. Omnitrace supports randomly sampling from subsets, e.g. { 0, 0, 5, 10 } 
     where 0% is randomly selected 50% of time and 5% and 10% are randomly selected 25% of the time
  #. Omnitrace and COZ have same definition for binary scope: the binaries 
     loaded at runtime (e.g. executable and linked libraries)
  #. Omnitrace "source scope" supports both ``<file>`` and ``<file>:<line>`` formats 
     in contrast to COZ "source scope" which requires ``<file>:<line>`` format
  #. Omnitrace supports a "function" scope which narrows the functions/lines 
     which are eligible for causal experiments to those within the matching functions
  #. Omnitrace supports a second filter on scopes for removing binary/source/function 
     caught by inclusive match, e.g. ``BINARY_SCOPE=.*`` + ``BINARY_EXCLUDE=libmpi.*``
     initially includes all binaries but exclude regex removes MPI libraries
  #. In Omnitrace, the Linux Perf backend is preferred over use libunwind. However, 
     Linux Perf usage can be restricted for security reasons.
     Omnitrace will fallback to using a second POSIX timer and libunwind if 
     Linux Perf is not available.
